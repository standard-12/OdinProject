    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>While most Konkani homes make sevai once or twice a month, we have ‘Sevai Sundays’ at home. My hubby absolutely
        loves these homemade rice noodles and enjoys them religiously three times a day on the Sundays I prepare them.
        &#128512; It’s a lot of effort, but when it’s for your loved one, it’s always worth it, right? ☺

        Sevai is incredibly versatile—you can have it with chicken, egg, or fish curry, or pair it with a spicy coconut
        chutney or pickle if you prefer a vegetarian option. It also tastes amazing with sweetened, cardamom-flavored
        coconut milk or simply with a drizzle of coconut oil. My hubby enjoys it with spicy green chilli-asafoetida
        water, while I love mixing it with crushed buttermilk chillies and coconut oil. Sevai also pairs beautifully
        with Konkani dishes like batate vagu. Plus, it tastes fantastic with sambar and mudduhuli—a unique sweet, sour,
        and spicy dish made by the Brahmins of coastal Udupi using pineapple, mango, and other ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of rice</li>
        <li>1 cup grated coconut (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Rice noodles press/chakuli/muruku press</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak dosa rice or sona masuri rice for a minimum of half an hour. After soaking wash them well and drain all the water.</li>
        <li>Gring rice with grated coconut into a smooth batter using as much water as needed.</li>
        <li>We need the batter watery to medium thick. Not too watery, not too thick. For 2 cups of rice, 2 cups of water should be enough, to make the perfect noodles.  The softness, the texture of the noodles totally depends on the amount of water you add.</li>
        <li>Transfer the ground rice into a large wok, add salt and mix well. Check and adjust salt.</li>
        <li>Set the flame to medium and cook the batter.</li>
        <li>As the batter cooks it starts to thicken and solidify.</li>
    </ol>
